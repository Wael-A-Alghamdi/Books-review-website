# Books Review Website
This is a basic front-end project for a book review website. No frameworks, no backend, just raw HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Created for practice.

##  Live Demo

##  Tech Used  
HTML  
CSS (handwritten)

##  Notes  
Static only – no server, no database.  
Forms don’t actually submit anywhere.  
Images are just basic banners and layout assets.
